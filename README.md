# FlipKart-Grid Ecommerce Application

A FullStack Ecommerce App built with Django, Blockchain and ReactJs.

With upcoming technology, blockchain is one such way to prove the ownership of the customers.
For this, physical warranty systems need to be replaced by digital warranty systems using NFT's.
Our website is capable of tracking all the transactions done using metamask and 
on resale, the productâ€™s ownership is updated both in the database and contract.
We have also updated the traditional repairment and return facilities using blockchain authentication.For more engagement of customers the website is also equipped with gamification in terms of warranty extension which can be redeemed as gifts.
Deloyed our contract using polygon blockchain.
